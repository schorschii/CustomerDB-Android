With this Android app you can manage your customers separated from the private contacts, business appointments and vouchers. It is also available for [iOS](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-ios).

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, platform independent, open source CRM application for small businesses without tracking or forced cloud connection. To enable non-technical users to use the sync feature, a cloud service is provided optionally. If you like this project, please support the development by purchasing one of the in-app purchases in the Play Store or via Github sponsoring, if you use the direct APK download.

You can set up your own self-hosted sync server using the [Customer Database Server](https://github.com/schorschii/customerdb-server), which is also open source.

Contributions welcome :-)
